# KoolChatFilter

Plugin made to catch a configurable list of words and add that player to a YAML file, preventing them from joining.

Basically saying "screw you" to the player for saying a slur and banning them.

## If you are using KoolSMPCore, you do not need this plugin. These are for the people that don't like KoolSMPCore yet still would like a chat filtering system.
